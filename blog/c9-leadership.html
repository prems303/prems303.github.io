      <div class="articleTitle">What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</div>
    </div>
      <p>Compassionate leadership, I think, takes a lot of effort but is the best kind because it helps to gain a trustworthy relationship instead of being intimidated by the leader. This gives a chance to share your thoughts, visions, ideas, likes and dislikes openly. In turn it creates a chain reaction of giving and taking feedback and making the group a better environment to be a part of.</p>

      <div class="articleTitle">Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</div>
    </div>
    <p>This exercise is one that made me think quite deep.</p>
 
      <p>Especially with the things that are taking place in the world, it’s quite easy to just focus on how bad our situation really is. But this exercise, I feel, is a good way to look past that feeling – whether it’s good and bad Police Officers, good and bad Muslims, or just normal day-to-day events in life no matter who is involved. Whatever argument it is that you just had, or a rumour you’ve heard, or even during the happy-ish times, it’s good to reel in the happiness and let it radiate from within us so that it will attract others and put a smile on their faces too.</p>

      <div class="articleTitle">Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</div>
    </div>
      <p>As Meng claimed in the book, this exercise is quite hard to get my head around. I think it would be easier for people who have quite a lot practice with the Meditation techniques. I wonder if this is because lack of self-confidence of finding/creating the happiness from within, or the fear of taking the negativity of someone else into our own hands despite having our own things bearing us down at times.</p>

      <div class="articleTitle">How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</div>
    </div>
      <p>In ‘Your Brain At Work’ there are 5 categories - each one being a major driver of social behaviour, these are “5 domains of social experience that the brain treats as primary rewards or threats”.</p>

      <ul><li>Status – relative importance, pecking order, or seniority
      Status threats triggered in times like talking to someone with a higher authority, or when your personal opinion is needed.</li>
      <li>
      Status rewards are activated relative to your former self such as learning a new skill/improving at something you already know.
      Certainty – quality of being reliably true</li>
      <li>Uncertainty = Error Responses ; Occupies the mind until resolved ; highly exhausting</li>
      <li> Autonomy – Perception of exerting control over one’s 

      environment.</li>
      <li>Relatedness – Perception of one as a ‘friend’ or ‘foe’
      Fairness</li>
 
      <p>When talking to fellow cohort members Status threats/rewards may have been triggered multiple times but most of the time unconsciously. Uncertainty was always around throughout all of Phase 0 because I didn’t want to do anything wrong, and the more I got into trouble the weaker my confidence grew.</p>
 
      <p>Autonomy, relatedness  and fairness are things that would most likely surface during bootcamp, as the whole group interacts face-to-face, working together and helping each other out.</p>

      <div class="articleTitle">Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)</div>
    </div>
      <p>It’s quite hard to get ideas across immediately because there’s so much you want to say but little comes out because thoughts are all jumbled up. Writing it all down gives you a chance review it. Despite how hard it can be, once it is done a sense of lightness overtakes you.<br><br>
      “Kindness is the engine of empathy; it motivates you to care, and it makes you more receptive to others, and them to you.” – The kinder you are to a person the easier is to be understanding towards that person and care about them<br><br>
      The subject of our thinking is what our mind tends to believe, and eventually we start believing it too.</p>

      <p>“The degree of control that organisms can exert over something that creates stress determines whether the stressor alters the organism’s functioning.”</p>
