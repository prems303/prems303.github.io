      <div class="articleTitle">Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</div>
    </div>
      <p>So far this week I didn’t need to use any of them. But I do realise from the past that the more you open up to them by slowly getting yourself to trust them, the more they will trust you. It doesn’t have to get really personal from the beginning itself, but just small things like how your day was, an argument you had, a general thing that is on your mind – anything that lays a foundation and builds a common ground as to who you are, what you stand for, your values and principles in life – will let them acknowledge who you are as a person and they will start sharing things too.</p>

      <div class="articleTitle">Try empathic listening - how did it go?</div>
    </div>
    <p>So empathic listening is something everyone does usually when having DMCs (deep meaningful conversations). What’s really nice about this exercise is (especially when trying for the first time) is that you are aware not only of what they’re saying but how you connect, their emotions and how it rises up similar feelings inside us, we become almost like a mirror – mirroring their feelings.</p>

      <div class="articleTitle">How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</div>
    </div>
      <p>It was different for sure, usually I’m the patient kind and when something happens I tend to keep it in, if need be I’ll talk to my family about it. But as I kept going down the ladder from people I love to people I dislike, I am not really surprised about the negative feelings that set in. But by the end of the exercise I was just filled with positive thoughts and a happy feeling (not exactly unicorns and cloud nine but happy). The idea of our brain being pre-wired to be social seems to be very true especially since every human likes to have some company with them.</p>

      <p>“Seek first to understand, then to be understood.” —Stephen R. Covey<br><br>
      “Kindness is the engine of empathy; it motivates you to care, and it makes you more receptive to others, and them to you.” – The kinder you are to a person the easier is to be understanding towards that person and care about them<br><br>
      The subject of our thinking is what our mind tends to believe, and eventually we start believing it too.</p>
