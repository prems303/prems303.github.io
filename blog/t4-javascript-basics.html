      <div class="articleTitle">How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS</div>
    </div>
      <p><strong>Hyper Text Markup Language</strong> is a main language is the main markup language that displays web pages and other information that can be displayed in any web browser.  It consists of tags enclosed in angle brackets like the one shown here.(< html>)  Many web browsers read HTML documents and make them into visible web pages like we are about to do in class.  The web page doesn’t necessarily display the tags but they interpret the content on the page.<br /><br />
      <strong>CSS</strong> also known as Cascading Style sheets is a sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.  CSS is also used to interpret the many things of a web page such as the layout, colors and fonts.<br /><br />
      <strong>JavaScript</strong> also known as JS is a prototype-base language that is dynamic, very weakly typed and has many first class functions.  JavaScript has become one of the most popular programming languages on the web.<br /><br />
      In conclusion HTML should be used for structuring content, CSS should apply many visual styles such as font and color, and JavaScript should be used for all interactions.</p>

      <div class="articleTitle">Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</div>
    </div>
      <p><strong>Control Flow Structures</strong> are an important aspect of programming languages that allow your code to take certain actions based on a variety of scenarios. Control Flow is a fundamental concept in programming that allows you to dictate how your code runs under different conditions or until a certain condition is met.<br /><br />
      The most common Control Flow Structure you will encounter is if, else, else if structure.<br /><br />
      Example: Getting ready to eat<br /><br />
      <strong>If</strong><br /><br />
      The <strong>if</strong> statement simply makes an evaluation and then does something depending on if the evaluation was true or false.<br /><br />
      Condition: Check if food is ready to eat.<br /><br />
      Evaluation: If the food is ready, eat the food<br /><br />
      <strong>Else</strong><br /><br />
      The above example will do something if the statement evaluates to true, but what if we wanted to do something if it evaluates to false? Well, we could use the <b>else</b> clause.<br /><br />
      Evaluation: If the food is not ready, prepare the food and eat<br /><br />
      Loops: Loops offer a quick and easy way to do something repeatedly.<br /><br />
      Practicle example of a loop: buy christmas gifts to the family
      <ul>
        <li>Go to the shop/mall and start shopping</li>
        <li>As you know the number, shop until you buy gifts (repeat the process till you have a gift for everyone)</li>
      </ul></p>

      <div class="articleTitle">Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals</div>
 
      <p><strong>Object Literals</strong><br /><br />
        Object Literals are Objects that you create on the fly. The syntax for Object literals is simple:
        <ul>
          <li>Enclose it in curly brackets</li>
          <li>separate properties with comma</li>
          <li>separate keys and values with a colon</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p>To access the values on this object, you can use “dot notation”, that is, the name of the object, a dot, and the name of the property.<br /><br />
        console.log(person.name);
        console.log(person.twitter);</p>
        <p><strong>Array Literals</strong>
        Just like objects, arrays can also be created on the fly. The syntax rules for array literals:
        <ul>
          <li>Enclose it in square brackets</li>
          <li>separate each element with comma</li></ul></p>
        <p>To access the values, you use a numerical index:
        console.log(arr[0]);
        </p>

      <div class="articleTitle">Explain what functions are and why they are useful</div>
 
      <p>A function is a group of reusable code which can be called anywhere in your program. This eliminates the need of writing the same code again and again. Functions allow a programmer to divide a big program into a number of small and manageable functions.<br /><br />
      The most common way to define a function in JavaScript is by using the function keyword, followed by a unique function name, a list of parameters (that might be empty), and a statement block surrounded by curly braces.
