<h1>Which time box and habits techniques did you try?</h1>

<p>Pomodoro technique is one that I'm very fond of as the 5 mins break every now and then helps me to refresh my mind. Fogg's idea of a small celebration after achieving a little something is always another way to boost my self-confidence.</p>

<h1>What did you find interesting?</h1>
  
  <p>I've actually never come across the fact that I could celebrate my achievements and break down my goals into very teenie tiny ones. But after an enlightening talk by BJ Fogg it feels like putting his techniques into practice might actually help me.</p>


<h1>What worked for you?</h1>

  <p>Quite early to make a judgement as to what is working and what is not but I am keeping an eye on it. I do tend to forget these new techniques but I am working towards making them a part of my daily routine and my personal habits.</p>


  <h1>What will you experiment further with? </h1>

  <p>Would definitely like to go on with the Pomodoro technique as it helps with many different tasks related and unrelated to EDA.<br />

  I want to try to be a lot more mindful about the work I'm doing and what I'm getting done, assess it and make tiny goals that are achievable as it brings my spirit up and I will be able to tackle the next tasks that are at hand with more determination and boldness. </p>
