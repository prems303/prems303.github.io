      <p>It is easy to be mindful while talking to others, but one can get distracted when others are talking about something you don’t understand or don’t have a part in, although you honestly mean good and want to listen sometimes the mind can be too distracted, and float away in a few seconds – “Dipping”. To avoid this we just need to be aware of the speaker and try not to judge them.<br /><br />
      “The most precious gift we can offer others is our presence. When mindfulness embraces those we love, they will bloom like flowers.” - Thich Nhat Hanh</p>
