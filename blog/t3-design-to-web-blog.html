      <div class="articleTitle">What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important</div>
    
      <p>Creating a website version each for a new resolution and device is virtually impossible.<br /><br />
        Responsive web design approaches website-making in such a way that the site organises and adapts to the screen size, platform and orientation depending on the user’s behaviour and/or environment, hence called a responsive site.<br /><br />
        This makes the website user-friendly by reducing any extra trouble with navigating and exploring the website. In return, it gets rid of the need for the developer to create multiple version of the same website, sort of like 1-size-fits-all.</p>

      <div class="articleTitle">What mobile first design is, and why it's important.</div>
    
      <p>Mobile-First approach is the ‘philosophy’ of progressive enhancement. It follows the idea of ‘starting small and moving on bigger things’. Mobile being the smallest screen it is easier to design the different elements needed and it also helps to narrow all ideas to the main ones that are absolutely essential for the website to fulfil its purpose. All extra features are only shown when applicable for eg: a drop down box is easier to handle on a desktop rather than on a mobile where one-click features are more useful.</p>

      <div class="articleTitle">What frameworks are, and their pros and cons.</div>
    
      <p>Frameworks are website structures that have been pre-organised hence determining the way a website is built.<br /><br />
      Pros being it is easier and faster and aids through the process of making the website. They have pre-written code and are tested across various devices.<br /><br />
      Cons: Adds extra code that may not be needed for the current website that you’re working hence you need to overwrite it. Because the frameworks are pre-designed it restricts your freedom to bend it towards your liking.</p>

      <div class="articleTitle">What a wireframe is and why we use it.</div>
    
      <p>Wireframes are plans of the layout/design of your webpage. It’s a productive way that helps to put all your idea in one place and you have a template of your own liking to go by, also saves time.</p>
