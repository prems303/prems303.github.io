      <div class="articleTitle">What is the relationship between mindfulness and self-awareness?</div>
    </div>
      <p>They follow the same principle, if you increase your mindfulness (the work and goals that are being set, the time etc.) the more self-aware you become of your body, emotions and actions. It becomes easier to control them, but more importantly, respond to them therefore reserving the chance of them exhausting you.<br /><br />
      “Self-awareness … is a neutral mode that maintains self-reflectiveness even in the midst of turbulent emotions.” — Daniel Goleman<br /><br />
      “Mindfulness means paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment, and non-judgmentally.” — Jon Kabat-Zinn</p>

      <div class="articleTitle">Try at least one of the self-awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</div>
    </div>
 
      <p>Accountability and Reflection is similar to keeping a journal, so I decided to do the Body Scan. It's the first time I tried it but found it was muck like the mindfulness practices, therefore it wasn’t too hard (“inside your throat” section was a bit different, whereas my daughter who is studying Biology in class just imagined the cells doing their job and their regular beat relaxed her).</p>

      <div class="articleTitle"> What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</div>
    </div>
 
      <p>A common misconception occurs when many people make themselves and emotions as one. This is a very subtle thought that is reflected in our personality and over time it becomes a habit that can’t be avoided and our mind captures it as a principle.<br /><br />
      It can’t be avoided until mindfulness or self-awareness comes into play. That’s when the emotions are not persons but feelings, and we are just us. We FEEL them but we AREN’T them (them being emotions).</p>
