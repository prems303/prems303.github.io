      <div class="articleTitle">How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</div>
    </div>
      <p>We can look at our lives through 3 different ‘P’ lenses:<br /><br />
      1) Pleasure: “Do what makes you happy” is the motto of these type of people, therefore are always chasing the next high but this sort of happiness is present for a short time.<br /><br />
      2) Passion: Also known as “flow,” where peak performance meets peak engagement, and time flies by. It is more sustainable and less likely to be habituated.<br /><br />
      3) ‘Higher’ Purpose: Relates to being part of something bigger than yourself that has meaning to you, things that parents usually try to engrave into your head but as kids we dismiss it.<br /><br />
      In life, we choose an aim – usually has a lot of value in our eyes, involves work, and getting somewhere and being someone better.  The faster this sort of practice becomes habitual the better because it is very resilient, worthwhile and the bliss that one feels when looking back at the journey is comforting.</p>

      <div class="articleTitle">How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</div>
    </div>
      <p>Resilience is the ability to overcome obstacles along the way and enthusiastically continue to plough through all hardships. Many are usually confused about the path they want to tale, instead of it becoming clearer as you get near it seems to get more blurry. Alignment and envisioning and resilience helps you get to a point where you can see exactly where you can see the path clearly.<br /><br />
      <p>We can train resilience on three levels:<br /><br />
      1) Inner calm: Situated in the mind - the foundation of all optimism and resilience.<br /><br />
      <p>“Think of happiness as a deep ocean. The surface may be choppy, but the bottom is always calm. Similarly, there are days when a deeply happy person may feel sad—for example, he sees people suffering—but underneath that sadness, there is a large depth of unwavering happiness.” – Mattheiu Ricard<br /><br />
      2) Emotional resilience: Success and failure are emotional experiences - without failure you cannot experience success, therefore having a taste of both sides will only one to appreciate life a lot more.<br /><br />
      3) Cognitive resilience: Understanding how we explain our setbacks to ourselves and creating useful mental habits help us develop optimism.<br /><br />
     Soichiro Honda famously said, “Success is 99 percent failure.”<br /><br />
      Thomas Watson said, “If you want to increase your success rate, double your failure rate.”<br /><br />
      Chinese proverb: “Failure is the mother of success.”</p>

    </div>
 
      <p>What distinguishes successful people is their attitude toward failure, and specifically, how they explain their own failures to themselves.<br /><br />
 
      Everything is connected… If we know what we value most and what is most meaningful to us, then we know what we can work on that serves our higher purpose. When that happens, our work can become a source of sustainable happiness for us. We can then become very good at our work because we are happy doing it, which in turn allows us to enjoy the happiness of flow with increasing frequency. Finally, when we become really good at our work, we may gain recognition.<br /><br />
 
      The three elements of true motivation are:<br /><br />
 
      1. Autonomy: The urge to direct our own lives<br /><br />
 
      2. Mastery: The desire to get better and better at something that matters<br /><br />
      3. Purpose: The yearning to do what we do in service of something larger than ourselves</p>
