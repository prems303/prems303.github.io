      <p>The ability to move from compulsion to choice is the common enabler for all 5 Emotional competencies in Self-Regulation:<br /><br />
      1. Self-control: Keeping disruptive emotions and impulses in check<br /><br />
      2. Trustworthiness: Maintaining standards of honesty and integrity<br /><br />
      3. Conscientiousness: Taking responsibility for personal performance<br /><br />
      4. Adaptability: Flexibility in handling change<br /><br />
      5. Innovation: Being comfortable with novel ideas, approaches, and information<br /><br />
      Self-Regulation comes in handy when small situations stimulates a large emotional responses. These triggers usually have long histories behind them and can be caused due to stress, tensions, overthinking, emotions built up inside etc… In times like this the Siberian North Railroad practice of Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, and Respond (SBNRR) is a go to action to take.</p>

      <div class="articleTitle">How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</div>
    </div>
      <p>This activity consisted of presenting a two minute monologue stating the event that was triggered, the feeling that arose and where in my body I felt it. I was speaking to my daughter telling her what was happening and trying very hard to gain control. It was a different approach to normal, and I’ve noticed the different ways my body reacts to the situation whether it was in the past or when facing it. But no matter how long it takes, once it is in control there’s nothing like it.</p>

      <p>Four very helpful general principles for dealing with any distressing emotions are:<br /><br />
 
      1. Know when you are not in pain.<br /><br />
 
      2. Do not feel bad about feeling bad.<br /><br />
 
      3. Do not feed the monsters (our distress, occupying the mind and wreaking havoc on our emotions).<br /><br />
 
      4. Start every thought with kindness and humour.</p>
