</div>
<p>HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) is the standard markup language to create web pages along with CSS (Casacading Style Sheets) which adds styles and DOM (Document Object Model) is described as a tree structure which means the nodes of all the documents are organised.<br /></p>
<p>Basically HTML is like the structure of the house. CSS represents colours, designs and styles in the house. DOM tells us about the number of contents of the house eg: bedrooms, bathrooms, kitchen and garage etc. </p>
