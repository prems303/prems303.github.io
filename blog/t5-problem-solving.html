      <div class="articleTitle">Tell your non-tech friend a story about a time you got blocked on a simple problem in an elegant way?</div>
    </div>
      <p>I was making simple mistakes while learning Javascript basics like the use of a curly bracket or a semicolon. I say simple because they are quite small and are quite often overlooked and with ease too. Without the punctuations inserted in the right place the commands are undefined and therefore I was unable to move through to the next lesson.<br /><br />
      Reading and re-reading the instructions, paying close attention to the error messages would provide an insight. I also started going through each line checking my capitals, commas, open brackets, curly brackets etc. If I couldn’t find my mistake I started surfing through the previous lessons and comparing to the current one which always helped to spot the mistakes.</p>

      <div class="articleTitle">Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving technniques and process:</div>
    </div>
      <p><strong>Pseudocode:</strong> As soon as I see the question, the first thing I do is write the pseudocode and then start solving the it.<br /><br />
      <p><strong>Trying something:</strong> I'm always trying something<br /><br />
      <p><strong>Rubber ducky method:</strong> I do this when I am stuck at some point and do not get the necessary output. I read the question aloud again and again till I understand where I am going wrong.<br /><br />
      <p><strong>Reading error messages:</strong> When I was doing the Javascript basics, this really helped me as it was giving the error message instantly through which I was able to correct my mistakes and complete the exercises.<br /><br />
      <p><strong>Console.logging:</strong> I really feel coding easy when i use console.log for debugging.<br /><br />
      <p><strong>Googling:</strong> I use Google a lot to find solutions.<br /><br />
      <p><strong>Asking your peers for help:</strong> My cohort group is very supportive and helpful at all times.<br /><br />
      <p><strong>Asking coaches for help:</strong> Even coaches are helpful to me.<br /><br />
      <p><strong>Improving your process with reflection::</strong> It does encourage me when I read my previous week’s reflection which helps me to focus and improve in the area where I am weak.</p>

      <div class="articleTitle">Explain the functions:</div>
 
      <p><strong>.map()</strong><br /><br />
        The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a function for every array element.<br /><br />
        Example (taken from w3schools)<br /><br />

        Return an array with the square root of all the values in the original array:<br /><br />
        var numbers = [4, 9, 16, 25];<br /><br />

        function myFunction() {<br />
        x = document.getElementById("demo")<br />
        x.innerHTML = numbers.map(Math.sqrt);<br />
        }<br /><br />
        The result will be:<br />
        2,3,4,5<br /><br />

        <strong>.filter()</strong><br /><br />
        The filter() method creates an array filled with all array elements that pass a test (provided as a function).<br /><br />
        Example (taken from w3schools)<br /><br />

        Return an array of all the values in the ages array that are 18 or over:<br /><br />
        var ages = [32, 33, 16, 40];<br /><br />

        function checkAdult(age) {<br />
        return age >= 18;<br />
        }<br /><br />
        The result will be:<br />
        32,33,40<br /><br />

        <strong>.reduce()</strong><br /><br />
        The reduce() method reduces the array to a single value.<br /><br />
        Example (taken from w3schools)<br /><br />

        Get the sum of the numbers in the array:<br /><br />
        var numbers = [65, 44, 12, 4];<br /><br />

        function getSum(total, num) {<br />
        return total + num;<br />
        }<br /><br />
        function myFunction(item) {<br />
          document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = numbers.reduce(getSum);<br />
        }<br /><br />
        The result will be:<br />
        125<br /><br />
