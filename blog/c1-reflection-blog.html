      <div class="articleTitle">What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</div>
    </div>
      <p>My first week was completely like chaos not understanding what goes where. Now that I have started to get a hang of it and understand what the EDS's intent is with training. Itseems to teach people more than just learning the code and the ball is in my court in how fast I can learn.</p>
    <div id="pageContent">
      <div class="articleTitle">What are your impressions?</div>
    </div>
 
      <p>I see that there are people coming from different background with diverse knowledge and skills. And I strongly believe that this will enable a person like me with no knowledge on software to grow faster and succeed as a developer.</p>
    <div id="pageContent">
      <div class="articleTitle">How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</div>
    </div>
      <p>I like EDA's culture as i can clear my doubts immediately and move on.</p>
    <div id="pageContent">
      <div class="articleTitle">Have your expectations at EDA changed?</div>
    </div>
      <p>Before joining EDA, I did quite a bit of research and how it works and whether it is the right platform for me to enter software field. And this remain the same.</p>
    <div id="pageContent">
      <div class="articleTitle">Are you excited to participate in this type of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</div>
    </div>
      <p>I am excited but at the same time nervous as well. The pace I am moving makes me nervous whether I can cope up or not but I made my decision to become a software proffessional and will not look back.</p>
