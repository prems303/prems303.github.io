      <p>NZ has an image of a clean, green country with friendly people who are generally quiet relaxed and nonchalant.</p>
      <p>I like the stunning beauty, fresh air, general friendliness and helpfullness of Kiwis, good service almost everywhere, and was initially fascinated with the 1 day-4 season weather. Honesty and trust are usually the attitudes of most Kiwis, in general and are willing to help friends and strangers alike who are in difficulty.</p>
      <p>My observations for poeple considering moving to Auckland is to be prepared to work hard to get a job (not an exception if you have tons of experience), accept rejection and move on. Try to get some NZ experience through volunteering, study etc.</p>
      <p>There is so much to see in NZ, and every bit is definitely worth it because the scenery here is amazing!! There are many activities to do in the weekend if you like being active or if you're an outdoors person - they can often be free. </p>
