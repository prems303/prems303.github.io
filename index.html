</div>

  
  <p>NZ has an image of a clean and green country with friendly people. People here are generally quiet relaxed and unhurried in everything they do.</p>
  <p>I like the stunning beauty, fresh air, the four seasons of weather, general friendliness and helpfullness of Kiwis, good service almost everywhere. Honesty and trust are usually the attitudes of most Kiwis in general and they are willing to help friends and strangers alike who are in difficulty.</p>
  <p>My observations for poeple considering moving to Auckland is to be prepared to work hard to get a job even if you have tons of experience. Accept rejection and move on. Try to get some NZ experience through volunteering, study etc.</p>
  <p>Scenery here is amazing and there are many activities to do on the weekend if you are active, outdoors person and they can often be free. There is so much to se  in NZ.</p>
